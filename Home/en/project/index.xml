      <title>The impact of the existence or absence of CM on fish’s intestinal microbiota environment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The chitin-based peritrophic matrix (PM) plays a crucial role in gut immunity and digestion in invertebrates. Traditionally, PM was believed to be absent in all vertebrates, however, a recently found PM-like chitinous membrane (CM) in fishes has challenged this notion and has the potential to enhance our understanding of vertebrate gut physiology and structural evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, our team aimed to investigate if the existence of the CM in  zebrafish gut would have an benefical or harmful impact on the survival of the fish, these two may have no correlation of course. To fullfill our goal, firstly, We created a complete genetic PM/CM knockout model through the prevalent &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CRISPR-Cas9&lt;/a&gt; gene editing technology. Then, we designed a series of rigorous experiments to test the influences of the absence of the CM on the fishes, including ingestion
behavior, microbial homeostasis, epithelial renewal, digestion, growth and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bioinformatics Mphil candidate, I was entrusted with the mission of designing a accurate and stable pipeline to analyse the 16S amplicon sequencing data which was a complexed work obviously. The first challenge we encountered was how to select a suitable platform for conducting our data analysis as there are many microbial data analysis platforms in the field. we ultimately decided to integrate the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drive5.com/usearch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;USEARCH&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://qiime2.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;QIIME 2&lt;/a&gt; for our data analysis after careful comparison. Specifically, USEARCH is known for its simplicity and refinement while QIIME 2 is powerful and comprehensive, they complement each other excellently. In fact, we solely utilized USEARCH to generate the feature table, which was the central step in the entire process and subsequent analyses were primarily conducted using relevant plugins from QIIME 2.
In order to enhance the reproducibility of the data analysis and facilitate potential interested researchers, I developed a simple software called &amp;ldquo;LuckyMicrobe.&amp;rdquo; Detailed information about this software can be found on my GitHub page(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Learnerhua/LuckyMicrobe-testing-&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/Learnerhua/LuckyMicrobe-testing-&lt;/a&gt; ), though it is still in the experimental stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, this research topic is still being further extended, and our team has a continuous demand for data analysis. As a result, this project remains ongoing, and I continue to improve my software constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recombinant Expression of PFO Protein through Genetic Engineering</title>
      <link>https://learnerhua.github.io/Home/en/project/undergraduate_thesis/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Produced by Pathogenic bacteria are responsible for causing grave concerns regarding human health due to the prevalence of infectious diseases. In the realm of clinical bacterial infections, antibiotics serve as the simplest and most efficacious drugs. Nonetheless, widespread evidence indicates that the excessive and inappropriate utilization of antibiotics has given rise to drug resistance and bacterial imbalance. In particular, the emergence of robust drug resistance in bacteria, commonly known as &amp;ldquo;super bacteria,&amp;rdquo; has evolved into a pressing matter. As a result, the need to swiftly develop potent and eco-friendly antibacterial substances has become paramount and demands immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We inserted the gene fragment expressing the PFO protein into the pET-28a plasmid vector, and then transformed the vector into BL21 (DE3) bacteria. Subsequently, we induced expression and conducted isolation and purification under suitable conditions. The protein was concentrated to the desired concentration, and its biological activity was determined. The results showed that the target protein was successfully expressed in large quantities, achieving a certain level of purity and concentration through separation, purification, and concentration steps. Additionally, we explored a series of optimal experimental conditions for the expression of PFO, laying a solid foundation for the follow-up experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we drawed a conclusion that the recombinant PFO can be induced to be expressed in large quantities in Escherichia coli and its expression can be greatly improved after experimental optimization. However, its activity in vitro remains to be further verified.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Synthesis of bio-nano material: MOFs(Metal-Organic Frameworks)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic bacteria are responsible for causing grave concerns regarding human health due to the prevalence of infectious diseases. In the realm of clinical bacterial infections, antibiotics serve as the simplest and most efficacious drugs. Nonetheless, widespread evidence indicates that the excessive and inappropriate utilization of antibiotics has given rise to drug resistance and bacterial imbalance. In particular, the emergence of robust drug resistance in bacteria, commonly known as &amp;ldquo;super bacteria,&amp;rdquo; has evolved into a pressing matter. As a result, the need to swiftly develop potent and eco-friendly antibacterial substances has become paramount and demands immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver-based inorganic and organic–inorganic composite materials have been widely exploited to show strong inhibitory or bactericidal effects on microbes. They have been increasingly used in many normal commodities and medical equipment. Lately, some pertinent metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have also appeared as novel antibacterial agents that exhibit some unique traits including a wide antibacterial spectrum, long periods of persistence, and promising efficacy. Compared to conventional drugs, MOF-based antibacterial agents have many advantages. The active sites of metal ions in the MOFs are effectively wrapped by the organic ligands and evenly distributed across the overall material, enabling a sustained release of metal ions to avoid the toxicity caused by a burst release of metal ions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we expanded our investigation into the antibacterial properties of MOFs composed of quaternized carboxylate ligands in combination with Ag+ ions. Two distinct MOFs were successfully synthesized under gentle conditions: a three-dimensional (3D) MOF denoted as [Ag2(Cedcp)]n (designated as 1, with H3CedcpBr representing N-(carboxyethyl)-(3,5-dicarboxyl)-pyridinium bromide), and a two-dimensional (2D) MOF {[Ag4(Cmdcp)2(H2O)4]·4H2O}n (referred to as 2, where H3CmdcpBr signifies N-(carboxymethyl)-(3,5-dicarboxyl)-pyridinium bromide). Notably, MOFs 1 and 2 exhibited exceptional water stability and solubility, alongside potent antimicrobial activity, while also demonstrating favorable biocompatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
