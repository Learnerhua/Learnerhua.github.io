Generally, we refer to proteins containing the ApeC domain as ACPs. Recent studies have confirmed that ACPs show agglutinating activity but no microbicidal activity to bacteria and participate in controlling the activation of the NF-κB pathway by interacting with TRAF6 moleculer. Meanwhile, the distribution of ACPs across the taxa has also been elucidated which suggested that they are mainly distributed in invertebrates and can be traced back to early prokaryotes, such as bacteria.\nBuilding upon the previous research, our team is dedicated to clarifying the characteristics and functions of ACPs in various phyla. In our latest research, we further revealed the distribution, structure, and functional characteristics of ACPs in the phylum Mollusca(taxonomy ID:6647). I was assigned one of the tasks involving data analysis. Simultaneously, I am taking charge of the analysing work of ACPs in the phylum platyhelminthes(taxonomy ID: 6157), normally known as the flatworm, the species within this phylum are mostly famous for their unparalleled regenerative abilities or notorious parasitic characteristics. Given the fact that intensive aquaculture is severely impacted by parasites, particularly monogenean, our research has been endowed with more practical meaning.\nUp to now, I have successfully accomplished the majority of tasks in the project and achieved numerous significant research outcomes, including assuring the existence of ACPs in Monogenean and free-living flatworms for the first time, finding that the ApeC domains in flatworms exhibit a repetitive tandem arrangement and so on. I am currently organizing these findings into a publishable academic paper and plan to publish it in the near future.\nMeanwhile, I have not halted my research efforts and am collaborating with others to explore the functional patterns of ACPs in bacteria.\n","date":1677628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677628800,"objectID":"23abd96c4b37f596183802eb8c0e8b8c","permalink":"https://learnerhua.github.io/Home/en/project/acps/","publishdate":"2023-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Home/en/project/acps/","section":"project","summary":"A research topic focus on exploring characteristics of ACPs among different taxa.","tags":["Ongoing"],"title":"Comparative Genomic Analysis of the ApeC Protein Family.","type":"project"},{"authors":["Zirui Yue","Zhaoyu Fan","Hao Zhang","Buhan Feng","Chengyi Wu","Shenghui Chen","Jihua Ouyang","Huiping Fan","Panwei Weng","Huixiong Feng","Shangwu Chen","Meiling Dong","Anlong Xu","Shengfeng Huang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

PM was traditionally considered lost in all vertebrates, but a PM-like chitinous membrane (CM) has recently been discovered in fishes, which may increase the knowledge on vertebrate gut physiology and structural evolution. Here, we show that in zebrafish, the CM affects ingestion behavior, microbial homeostasis, epithelial renewal, digestion, growth, and longevity. Young mutant fish without CM appear healthy and are able to complete their life cycle normally, but with increasing age they develop gut inflammation, resulting in gut atrophy. Unlike mammals, zebrafish have no visible gel-forming mucin layers to protect their gut epithelia, but at least in young fish, the CM is not a prerequisite for the antibacterial gut immunity. These findings provide new insights into the role of the CM in fish prosperity and its eventual loss in tetrapods. These findings may also help to improve fish health and conservation, as well as to advance the understanding of vertebrate gut physiology and human intestinal diseases.","tags":[""],"title":"Differential roles of the fish chitinous membrane in gut barrier immunity and digestive compartments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jin Li","Shumin Liu","Yang Zhang","Qiuyun Huang","Hao Zhang","Jihua OuYang","Fan Mao","Huiping Fan","Wenjie Yi","Meiling Dong","Anlong Xu","Shengfeng Huang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

In amphioxus, a short-form ApeC-containing protein (ACP) family is capable of binding peptidoglycan (PGN) and agglutinating bacteria via its ApeC domain. However, the functions of ApeC in other phyla remain unknown. Here we examined 130 ACPs from gastropods and bivalves, the first and second biggest mollusk classes. They were classified into nine groups based on their phylogenetics and architectures, including three groups of short-form ACPs, one group of apextrins and two groups of ACPs of complex architectures. No groups have orthologs in other phyla and only four groups have members in both gastropods and bivalves, suggesting that mollusk ACPs are highly diversified. We selected one bivalve ACP (CgACP1; from the oyster Crossostrea gigas) and one gastropod ACP (BgACP1; from the snail Biomphalaria glabrata) for functional experiments. Both are highly-expressed, secreted short-form ACPs and hence comparable to the amphioxus ACPs previously reported. We found that recombinant CgACP1 and BgACP1 bound with yeasts and several bacteria with different affinities. They also agglutinated these microbes, but showed no inhibiting or killing effects. Further analyses show that both ACPs had high affinities to the Lys-type PGN from S. aureus but weak or no affinities to the DAP-type PGN from Bacillus subtilis. Both recombinant ACPs displayed weak or no affinities to other microbial cell wall components, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), zymosan A, chitin, chitosan and cellulose, as well as to several PGN moieties, including muramyl dipeptide (MDP), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc). Besides, CgACP1 had the highest expression in the gill and could be greatly up-regulated quickly after bacterial challenge. This is reminiscent of the amphioxus ACP1/2 which serve as essential mucus lectins in the gill. Taken together, the current findings from mollusk and amphioxus ACPs suggest several basic common traits for the ApeC domains, including the high affinity to Lys-type PGN, the bacterial binding and agglutinating capacity, and the role as mucus proteins to protect the mucosal surface.","tags":[""],"title":"Two novel mollusk short-form ApeC-containing proteins act as pattern recognition proteins for peptidoglycan","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The chitin-based peritrophic matrix (PM) plays a crucial role in gut immunity and digestion in invertebrates. Traditionally, PM was believed to be absent in all vertebrates, however, a recently found PM-like chitinous membrane (CM) in fishes has challenged this notion and has the potential to enhance our understanding of vertebrate gut physiology and structural evolution.\nIn this project, our team aimed to investigate if the existence of the CM in zebrafish gut would have an benefical or harmful impact on the survival of the fish, these two may have no correlation of course. To fullfill our goal, firstly, We created a complete genetic PM/CM knockout model through the prevalent CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. Then, we designed a series of rigorous experiments to test the influences of the absence of the CM on the fishes, including ingestion behavior, microbial homeostasis, epithelial renewal, digestion, growth and longevity.\nAs a bioinformatics Mphil candidate, I was entrusted with the mission of designing a accurate and stable pipeline to analyse the 16S amplicon sequencing data which was a complexed work obviously. The first challenge we encountered was how to select a suitable platform for conducting our data analysis as there are many microbial data analysis platforms in the field. we ultimately decided to integrate the USEARCH and QIIME 2 for our data analysis after careful comparison. Specifically, USEARCH is known for its simplicity and refinement while QIIME 2 is powerful and comprehensive, they complement each other excellently. In fact, we solely utilized USEARCH to generate the feature table, which was the central step in the entire process and subsequent analyses were primarily conducted using relevant plugins from QIIME 2. In order to enhance the reproducibility of the data analysis and facilitate potential interested researchers, I developed a simple software called “LuckyMicrobe.” Detailed information about this software can be found on my GitHub page(https://github.com/Learnerhua/LuckyMicrobe-testing- ), though it is still in the experimental stage.\nCurrently, this research topic is still being further extended, and our team has a continuous demand for data analysis. As a result, this project remains ongoing, and I continue to improve my software constantly.\n","date":1656633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656633600,"objectID":"40bd6c9180e8e3fd1d9c5be44e6bb37b","permalink":"https://learnerhua.github.io/Home/en/project/microbiomics/","publishdate":"2022-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/Home/en/project/microbiomics/","section":"project","summary":"A research topic focus on analyzing 16S amplicon sequencing data.","tags":["Ongoing"],"title":"The impact of the existence or absence of CM on fish’s intestinal microbiota environment","type":"project"},{"authors":["Bao-Ping Xie","Jin-Wei Chai","Cheng Fan","Ji-Hua Ouyang","Wen-Jun Duan","Bin Sun","Jun Chen","Li-Xia Yuan","Xue-Qing Xu","Jin-Xiang Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Both MOFs 1 and 2 show good water stability and solubility ascribed to their characteristic aromatic rings and positively charged pyridinium of the ligands, as well as the presence of Ag+ on their surface, leading to strong antimicrobial activity and a wide antimicrobial spectrum toward Gram-negative and positive bacteria. The results indicated that MOF 2 possesses a faster antibacterial activity (60 min) than MOF 1 (120 min). Scanning electron microscopy analysis further suggests that the Ag-based MOFs are capable of rupturing the bacterial membrane, leading to cell death. Moreover, both MOFs exhibit little hemolytic activity against mouse erythrocytes and show good biocompatibility in vitro, rendering MOFs 1 and 2 potential therapeutic agents for diseases caused by bacteria.","tags":[""],"title":"Water-Stable Silver-Based Metal–Organic Frameworks of Quaternized Carboxylates and Their Antimicrobial Activity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Produced by Pathogenic bacteria are responsible for causing grave concerns regarding human health due to the prevalence of infectious diseases.

In particular, the emergence of robust drug resistance in bacteria, commonly known as “super bacteria,” has evolved into a pressing matter. As a result, the need to swiftly develop potent and eco-friendly antibacterial substances has become paramount and demands immediate attention.\nSilver-based inorganic and organic–inorganic composite materials have been widely exploited to show strong inhibitory or bactericidal effects on microbes. They have been increasingly used in many normal commodities and medical equipment. Lately, some pertinent metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have also appeared as novel antibacterial agents that exhibit some unique traits including a wide antibacterial spectrum, long periods of persistence, and promising efficacy. Compared to conventional drugs, MOF-based antibacterial agents have many advantages. The active sites of metal ions in the MOFs are effectively wrapped by the organic ligands and evenly distributed across the overall material, enabling a sustained release of metal ions to avoid the toxicity caused by a burst release of metal ions.\nIn this study, we expanded our investigation into the antibacterial properties of MOFs composed of quaternized carboxylate ligands in combination with Ag+ ions. Two distinct MOFs were successfully synthesized under gentle conditions: a three-dimensional (3D) MOF denoted as [Ag2(Cedcp)]n (designated as 1, with H3CedcpBr representing N-(carboxyethyl)-(3,5-dicarboxyl)-pyridinium bromide), and a two-dimensional (2D) MOF {[Ag4(Cmdcp)2(H2O)4]·4H2O}n (referred to as 2, where H3CmdcpBr signifies N-(carboxymethyl)-(3,5-dicarboxyl)-pyridinium bromide).
